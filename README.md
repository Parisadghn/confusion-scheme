# Learning Phase Transition by Confusion scheme
the problem of determining whether a given quantum state is entangled or separable is known to be an NP-hard problem in general, and even the task of calculating order-parameters is time consuming and mostly impossible. 

Here is a feed forward neural-network approach to finding phase transitions, based on the performance of a neural network after it is trained with data that are deliberately labelled incorrectly.
The Ising model data is 30*30 lattice generated by Metropolis algorithm (Monte Carlo).
